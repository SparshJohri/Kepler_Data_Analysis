    "Run each cell by clicking the number in the top-left corner. You need to run the cells in the order they are presented. Once you have done so, you should see two graphs: one by the python matplotlib library (blue one on the top), and one by the lightkurve library (black one on the bottom). I have implemented a form of outlier removal. It removes values that are more than 5 sigma from the average of the data. Comment out the \"lc = outlier_removal(lc, sigma_value)\" line in the plot_EPIC_ID function in order to see how the graphs look with the outliers."
